# Package

If you downloaded this as a package, you can extract it and open any pages. Or
optionally, start a local server by running `serve.py`. After that, your site will
be available locally on your device at [localhost port 24580](http://localhost:24580)
(or as provided by the script). See [this article](https://vytdev.github.io/downloading)
for more information.

See the [releases](https://github.com/vytdev/vytdev.github.io/releases) section
